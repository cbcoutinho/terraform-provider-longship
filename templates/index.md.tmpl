# Longship Provider

The Longship provider is used to interact with resources supported by the
Longship CPO platform. The provider needs to be configured with the proper
credentials before it can be used.

## Getting Started

This provider must configured with an active instance of the Longship.io
platform. After you've generated a tenant and application key pair, proceed to
initializing the provider.
